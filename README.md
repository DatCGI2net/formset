# formset
Models: a Setup has as many as Specificaitons


It is started for bidding a project on upwork. That leads me to have the forms which to create or update two tables: master and details. 
So when add/update, one master will have two details records. That will ease a lot if you use regular ading/updating master/details rows, including with orm

One other feature will have is to have the delete check box working that I don't know how to attach it to the ModelForm of django yet.
